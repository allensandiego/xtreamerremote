# Privacy Policy

Last revised on February 7, 2019.

### The Gist

Remote for Xtreamer will collect certain non-personally identify information about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group of users, not individuals.

We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with it.

That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.

### Questions

If you have question about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@allensandiego.com

### Visitors

Like most website operators, Remote for Xtreamer collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Remote for Xtreamer's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Remote for Xtreamer's visitors use its website. From time to time, Remote for Xtreamer may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Remote for Xtreamer also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Remote for Xtreamer does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of Service.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Remote for Xtreamer's websites choose to interact with Remote for Xtreamer in ways that require Remote for Xtreamer to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Remote for Xtreamer gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Remote for Xtreamer collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Remote for Xtreamer. Remote for Xtreamer does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

### Aggregated Statistics

Remote for Xtreamer may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Service. For instance, Remote for Xtreamer may monitor the most popular parts of the application. Remote for Xtreamer may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Remote for Xtreamer does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Remote for Xtreamer discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Remote for Xtreamer's behalf or to provide services available at Remote for Xtreamer's application, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Remote for Xtreamer will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Remote for Xtreamer discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Remote for Xtreamer believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Remote for Xtreamer, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address, Remote for Xtreamer may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Remote for Xtreamer and our products. We primarily use our website and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Remote for Xtreamer takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
